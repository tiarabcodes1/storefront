# Storefront APP

This is a web application that allows users to interact with an e-Commerce storefront using React with Redux, coupled with a live API server.

## Current Deployment

[Check out the Storefront Web App!](https://tiarabcodes1.github.io/storefront/)

## During this phase the following milestones were reached

During this phase of the web application I will be adding a two full page views to the application: Product Details and Checkout.

- Allows users to see a full detail view of a product so that I can make a more informed choice about purchasing it.
- Allows users to  view full cart and initiate the checkout process so that I can purchase my items and have them delivered
